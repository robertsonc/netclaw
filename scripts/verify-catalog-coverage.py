"""Verify that scripts/lib/catalog.sh has installer coverage for every MCP
integration NetClaw ships today.

Contract: specs/049-merge-modular-installer/contracts/catalog-entry-format.md
Data model: specs/049-merge-modular-installer/data-model.md

Two ground-truth sources are checked against the catalog:

1. config/openclaw.json's mcpServers keys -- structured, exact server ids.
   A registered key is "covered" if, after stripping a trailing -mcp/-mcp-
   server suffix, it equals a catalog id exactly, OR it matches an explicit
   prefix-group rule (GROUPED_CONFIG_PREFIXES) for catalog entries that
   intentionally bundle several servers under one selectable component
   (e.g. "checkpoint" covers every chkp-* server, "chrome-devtools" covers
   both the headless and Watch Mode registrations).

2. scripts/verify-inventory-counts.py's EXTERNAL_INTEGRATIONS list --
   human-readable names for integrations NetClaw supports that are NOT
   registered as static config/openclaw.json entries (installed on demand,
   remote/OAuth, or bundled into an existing skill's runtime). Matched
   against catalog entries via an explicit map for names this feature
   specifically added coverage for, falling back to a best-effort keyword
   match for the rest (this script's job is to prove *this feature's*
   closure and catch *future* drift, not to retroactively hand-verify
   coverage that already existed before this feature touched the catalog).

No third-party dependencies. Run from anywhere; paths resolve relative to
this file's location, not the caller's cwd.
